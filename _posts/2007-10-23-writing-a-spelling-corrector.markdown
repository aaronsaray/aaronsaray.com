Normally I like to post content that I've actually written, but I can't pass up linking to this article: [How to write a spelling corrector](http://www.norvig.com/spell-correct.html).  Its a great piece that explains the math behind the spelling correcting that Google, Yahoo, etc... do when you're doing a search and gives code examples on how this is accomplished.  Very great read!
