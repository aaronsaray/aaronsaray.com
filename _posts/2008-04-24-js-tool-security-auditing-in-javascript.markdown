JSTool was a trial run of combining many different scripts from the open source community into a security and auditing script.

Features would include history viewing, website status reporting and port scanning. Very little original code - just combinations of existing code.  Check             the comments for proper author attribution.  This script really isn't             in working condition for production distribution.  Download it and              learn from it.
