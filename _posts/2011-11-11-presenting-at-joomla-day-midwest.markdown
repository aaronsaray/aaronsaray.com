Hello all.  It's been quite the long time since I updated my blog.  I know, I know, this is a huge problem, considering this is a cardinal sin according to my talk at [MKEPUG](http://www.mkepug.org/events/12607927/) about getting job offers.  That was wrong, I know.  However, things have been pretty busy.  Let's see...

A) Finished up my presentation for Zend about Zend Filter

B) Studying for the Linux+ exam (While I'm still doing some college classes, I also keep up on my [certifications](http://aaronsaray.com/resume/).)

C) Ran over to Madison to do a presentation on [PHP Design Patterns](http://www.madisonphp.com/events/29611571/).

D) Working with Joel to bring on a new [MKEPUG](http://mkepug.org) leadership team and working with Steve to help on the [Web Design Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/milwaukeeweb/).

E) ... and now, I'm presenting about

[Cloud Hosting and SaaS at Joomla Day Midwest](http://joomladaymidwest.org/speakers/aaron-saray-wisconsin.html).  

**Update!  Presentation can be downloaded:** [Here (PDF)](/uploads/2011/Harnessing_the_Cloud_for_SaaS_Hosted_Platfor.pdf)

Hope to see people out there.  Make sure to DM me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/aaronsaray) if you want a discount code (Yup, you'd be a super late-bird but still save $25!).

Oh - and make sure you stay tuned.  New topics coming out shortly on the blog including:




  * More PHPUnit testing methodologies


  * Leadership for PHP Programmers


  * Filters for Zend Framework


  * Writing good auditing for your applications


  * ACL's in PHP and Zend Framework


  * Masking Credit Card Information


  * and more!
