When running YSlow the other day, I was reminded that I was loading 2 stylesheets when only one would suffice.  So, let this be a reminder to you - and a quick excerpt at my own solution:

**Combine your Print and Screen stylesheets using the @media tag**

For example, in my print stylesheet, I wanted all input boxes with class `userinfo` to be hidden.  Instead of doing that, I now have one stylesheet with this excerpt:

```css
input.userinfo {
  border: 1px solid #000
}
@media print {
  input.userinfo {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

The style is to put a solid border on that particular input.  However, when media type is print, just don't show it at all.  No more double requests for stylesheets.
