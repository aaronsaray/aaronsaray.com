title: Which Conference Should I go to - Help me in 2008

So, luckily, my current employer will pay and make arrangements for me to attend one major conference each year.  Last year I attended Mysqlconf, the year before, Zend Con.

Which should I go to this year?  Here are the things to consider:
	
  * I don't have a US passport - so it has to be in the US - Unless there is enough lead time to get a passport (how much time does that take anymore these days?  Do I need to wear the mark of the beast now? *squints at Real-ID*)
	
  * It has to be something web related (yah very clear Aaron - thanks.  Microsoft makes front page and windows Live search - does that make them web related?  *sigh*  This means web programming language, analysis or tool based.  I don't know how more broad ones like 'future of web apps' types would work...)
	
  * I'd like it to be focused on open source (oracle fans, be damned!)

So - it's pretty simple.  Any suggestions?
