title: Don't Underestimate the Importance of Work Space

I've read the articles and studies about workers creating their own work spaces and I think it's a great idea.  (In fact, the company should too - it [increases efficiency by 32%!](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/200208.php))  But, I never really realized how important it was until recently.

There have been a lot of office space movement in the last few months at my current employer.  I never worried too much about what will happen - what happens, happens.  However, I thought there wasn't enough communication about the specifics.  I didn't go much past that.

Turns out, my group of employees was feeling much more stress and uncertainty than I originally realized.  Not knowing exactly where they'd go, who would be by them, what kind of desk they'd have was driving them nuts.

So, if I can give any advice out there to the managers (besides more communication is always better), really pay attention to the wants/needs of your staff - especially when it comes to workspace.  They are here usually more than 1/3rd of their day and it really matters.  Too often, managers forget about 'what it was like' - don't do this like I did! :)
