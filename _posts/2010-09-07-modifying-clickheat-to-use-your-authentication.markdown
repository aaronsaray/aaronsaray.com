title: Modifying Clickheat to use your authentication

A nice free open source alternative to Crazy Egg is [ClickHeat](http://www.labsmedia.com/clickheat/index.html).  One of my clients wanted this implemented but didn't want to have to log in again using different criteria.  I looked at the code and saw it was surprisingly easy to edit to allow a different authentication method.  Let's check it out:

First, open up **`index.php`** in your editor.  Find the statement where it checks to see if the `CLICKHEAT_CONFIG` file exists.  This should be around line 81.  On the opposite side of this IF statement, it then starts to do the authentication.  It includes the `CLICKHEAT_CONFIG` file.  Then, it checks to see if `isset($_COOKIE)`.

Above the `isset()` call and below the clickheat config include, put your custom code.  The important line is to define `CLICKHEAD_ADMIN`.
For example, you could do this:

```php?start_inline=1
include CLICKHEAT_CONFIG;

if ($_SESSION['userIsAdmin']) {
  define('CLICKHEAT_ADMIN', true);
}
else {
  die(header('/normalLoginPage.php'));
}
```
    
Then, you can remove - or comment - the code block that starts with

```php?start_inline=1
if (isset($_COOKIE['clickheat']))
```

all the way down to the end of that IF statement... it ends at these lines:

```php?start_inline=1
  }
  $__action = 'login';
}
```

This should now allow the script to use your authentication system and not its own.
