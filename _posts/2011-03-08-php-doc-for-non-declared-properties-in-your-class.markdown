You may find while working with projects like Zend Framework that you have a number of publicly available properties of your classes that are not defined and documented.  They might be part of a getter/setter magic method or just purely dynamic.  Well, using PHPDoc, there is a cool tag called [property](http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/PHP/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.property.pkg.html) that helps.  For example...

**Base class with getter/setters**

```php?start_inline=1
class base
{
  /**
   * @var data storage
   */
  protected $_data = array();
    
  /**
   * setter method - used to store data in self::$_data
   */
  public function __set($name, $value)
  { 
    $this->_data[$name] = $value;
  }
    
  /**
   * getter method - retrieves info from self::$_data
   */
  public function __get($name)
  {
    return isset($this->_data[$name]) ? $this->_data[$name] : null;
  }
}
```

Now, let's say we have an object of type Person which we know will have a first name and a last name.  However, its not defined in this class for some reason.

**Class with @property definition**

```php?start_inline=1
class person extends base
{
  // @property string $first_name The user's first name
  // @property string $last_name The user's last name
}
```

Now, when creating instance of this class, if your IDE supports PHPDoc, you will now have those previously undocumented and undefined properties available.
