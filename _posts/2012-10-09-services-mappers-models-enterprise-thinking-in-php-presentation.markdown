One thing I'm really passionate about is using PHP in enterprise situations.  I obviously care about [Design Patterns](/book) in PHP.  I've also done a lot of technical review of other books about refactoring away from bad code.  

One of the major areas that I like to focus on in Enterprise PHP is the separation of concerns between data sources, retrieval of logical organization, and business logic.  That's where the concept of Services, Mappers, and Models comes from.

Below, you'll see a link to my slides where I go into more detail, talk about the gains from this process, and show demonstration code.  This presentation was made at [Milwaukee PHP Users Group](http://mkepug.org).
