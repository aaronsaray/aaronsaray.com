I've heard the argument so many times: "I'm just too busy to do my own website"  This usually is followed by pleading statements leading to the fact that no one is paying them to do their own website - like their current workload is paying them.

**False!**

And here's why... Let's say you're working at a fast food restaurant making $1 more than minimum wage.  The company will allow you to work as much extra as you want - so maybe you're working 60 or 70 hours.  You're making "decent" money, but you're too busy to go back to college.  You've heard that if you get a college degree, you could enter the business world, and make 2,3, even 5 times more money than you are now.  But you're just ... too busy.

That's the same way I feel about web developers who don't take the time to make their own website and portfolio.

If you've followed me so far, you know I value **striving to always be better** - and isn't that what we're all trying to do?  Well it's time to show people!

Let me break it down for you:

**Excuse:** I've got more than enough work from word of mouth.

_Reply:_ Will you always?  What if the 2 or 3 people who are feeding you work found someone who will send them referral checks/bonuses?  What if that source dries up - will you always have "more than enough" work from word of mouth?

**Excuse:** I'm just too busy to work on my own website.

_Reply:_ First of all, this isn't a gig for a customer.  It doesn't have a due date. JUST START IT NOW - it doesn't have to be done in a week.  Second, if you start to understand the value of this tool, I guarantee you you'll find the time for it.  Watching "Burn Notice" tonight?  Don't - start on your website - and watch it later on Hulu.

**Excuse:** No one is paying me for my own websites - but my clients pay me for that work.

_Reply:_ Let me point back to the fast food restaurant.  The website is an investment (like college or tech school?).  Want to make more, make your website.

**Excuse:** Everyone in my area knows I'm "this good" so I don't have to go and brag.

_Reply:_ The internet is global.  How will I know you're that good? I don't live in your community?  What about other potential employers, publishers, etc?

**Excuse:** I don't care.

_Reply:_ Well then I really can't help you! :)

**Seriously though - do it.**

It's time.  Take the time to create your website to feature yourself.  It's well worth it.  Fire up your blog and share. (Side note: don't tell me, if you're a PHP programmer or something similar, that you didn't learn from other people's blogs.... pay it forward!)

_Proud of your work?_ You can always comment on my website and post a link - I'd love to check out what you're doing.
