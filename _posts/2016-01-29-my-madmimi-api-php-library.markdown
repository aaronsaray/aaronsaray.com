At [Small Shops United](https://www.smallshopsunited.com), we use MadMimi for our email list software.  I took a look at the PHP libraries that were available and found them extremely out of date, lacking, and just plain not working in certain areas.  

I had the need to integrate with their services, so I decided to create an updated open source PHP library.  You can find that here: [github.com/aaronsaray/madmimi-api-php](https://github.com/aaronsaray/madmimi-api-php).  I'm currently using this in production and it's performing great.

Next step - get MadMimi to add it to their support page.  Here's hoping!  (At least it's in packagist for composer install, though.)
