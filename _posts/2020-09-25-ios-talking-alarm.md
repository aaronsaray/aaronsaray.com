Lately, I've been thinking about waking up to a more positive message than just some random music. While there are apps that can create and play special alarms, I didn't want to install something new or buy something else. I decided to see if I could get a text-based alarm to happen with iOS shortcuts. **tldr:** I did.

To get started, you'll have to determine when you want to be woken up, and what you'd like the alarm to say.  There are only a few voices available in the Shortcuts' app, however.  But, I'm sure it'll work just fine for you. Here are the instructions:

Open the Shortcuts app and choose the Automations menu item at the bottom.

Choose to create a personal automation.

And then make sure to pick a time of day.

For this demo, I chose to receive my alarm at 8a.m.

Next, you can add an action.

I searched for text and chose the text option in the list of results.

There you'll be presented with the area that you want to type your text to bread aloud during the alarm.

While I chose a quote from Stuart Smalley, you could also use other Shortcuts Workflow items to populate variable data in this form (for example, reading a famous quote of the day from an RSS feed).

Then click next to save. Click the plus sign to add another action. I started to search 'Speak'.

After you pick the Speak text option in the results list, you can customize it when you click Show More.  I just kept it as it is.

Then, I selected next.  Here is where you can preview the new automation. I unchecked 'Ask Before Running' and confirmed.  I want it to run to wake me up.

And there you go, now my talking alarm is set.
