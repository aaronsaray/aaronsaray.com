Hello friends - I'm trying to get an idea if this would be a good idea.  Let me know your thoughts in the comments.

[![I Like Code!](/uploads/2013/hithere-300x104.png)](/uploads/2013/hithere.png){: .thumbnail}{: .pull-right}

Here's the idea (...knowing my experience in web development and programming...)
 
**Would you contract me for a 1-on-1 code review via skype or google hangout?**

Here's how it would work:

  * Application form takes care of contact information, scheduling, payment, short description of the product, and a way to access the source code.

  * Once payment is received and schedule is confirmed, I would review the application and check the code out.  In a case where I'm unable to assist, I would immediately refund the payment and connect them with someone who has relevant experience.

  * During the scheduled time, the coder and I would connect via skype or google hangout and share a screen of code.  I would listen to concerns or give my assessments of the code.  My goal would be to help build a quality, bug-free product while teaching some core techniques.

  * The appointment would last a duration of 30 minutes.

  * Afterward, the coder is asked to leave a rating and a review - on completion of this step, they would become available for a discount/reward on their next session.

I understand that this could be tough.  Here are the **problems** I see so far...

  * Not infinitely scalable - I only have so much time

  * What is the value of this service - is it the same to each coder?

  * What to charge?

  * What to do if a coder disagrees with my advice?

  * Scheduling conflicts

Do you think this would be a good idea?  Or not so much?  Leave a comment with your feedback - I'd also like to hear what you think would be a fair price for this service (and what metro area you're in - because that can make a difference.)  Thanks!
