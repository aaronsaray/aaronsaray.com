Do you like to be challenged, learn new things, and have a supportive team?  Well, let's chat a bit.  I'm building a team and I'm looking for great PHP developers to join it.  

**What would I be doing?**

You would be a core member of the team.  I'm looking at you, Mr. I have 5+ years of experience.  You've been there, done that, and now are looking to both share your experience with junior programmers as well as take on large projects, demonstrating your knowledge of best practices, reliability and scalability.  The company is both supportive and flexible with their IT staff.  Your immediate supervisor (me) and the VP of IT both support training opportunities, knowledge sharing, and sharing tips and tricks (We're continuing to build our wiki now!).  Mainly working with Zend Framework, jQuery, and HTML5/CSS3, together with the team, you will support business applications that will continue to stay with the company for years.  There is plenty of work, but there is plenty of room for both personal and professional growth.

**Who would I be working with?**

You would be working with the core web developer team.  The team ranges from veteran to novice.  The team also directly interfaces with the creative department to access user interface mockups, designs, and branding.  A good portion of the priorities would be set by the team leader (once again, me), but always with getting your input.  The industry is a print based industry moving more features onto the internet.

**What are the requirements?**

* 5+ years of Object Oriented PHP 5 experience
* HTML5/CSS3 experience
* A sense of humor
* jQuery/Javascript experience
* Knowledge of API and services including REST, SOAP, and the ability to craft custom XML.
* foosball skills
* Work with a team as well as by yourself
* Zend Framework experience
* Drupal/Joomla/Wordpress -nice to have- experience
* Working on-site in New Berlin (Milwaukee, Wisconsin!)

**What Company?**

The company is Liturgical Publications Inc (LPi).  Now, don't be scared off by the name.  True, almost all of the customers are church/parish based, but our team's customer is the business itself.  You do not have to have any religious views, affiliations, or experience to work here.  The company has been in business for almost half a century.  The main business is printing and delivering church bulletins while securing advertising revenue from print ads on the backs of them.  Our team assists with moving more of this process online and automated as well as providing support for various web properties both as value-ads and stand alone salable products.  Check out [LPi](http://4lpi.com) for more.

**How do I apply?**
