I don't want to admit it - but I messed up.  I didn't patch wordpress - and I was a victim of one of the released wp exploits.  _How could you let this happen?_ you ask.  Well, I was lazy.  But let this be a lesson to ya - don't forget - otherwise its a LOT harder to clean it up (it took me roughly 4 hours to fix which included 2 hours of ignoring my friend on the phone...)

For good measure, I'll hook you up with some worthwhile links to help you secure your WP:

Main Article about [Wordpress Security Tips and Hacks](http://www.noupe.com/how-tos/wordpress-security-tips-and-hacks.html).  He links to [Three tips to protect your wordpress](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/three-tips-to-protect-your-wordpress-installation/) from matt and also [wp designer's tips on security](http://www.wpdesigner.com/2008/01/30/wordpress-tips-part-1/).  Oh and if you're really gutzy - or lazy - check out the [wp scanner](http://blogsecurity.net/wordpress/tools/wp-scanner/) - should help you take care of some stuff.

Don't screw up like I did - lazy isn't worth it! ;)
