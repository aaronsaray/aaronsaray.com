After transitioning away from the doomed Google Reader to Feedly, I found it to be awesome!  I only had one gripe with the shortcut key scenario... when you went to view the entire article in a new tab, it was always focused.  This meant I'd still have to middle click with my mouse to put my tabs in the background.

After doing some research, I found a bunch of people actually had that problem.  So I decided to make a chrome extension.

With "Feedly Background Tab" you can press the keyboard key **b** and it will open the current viewing story in a background tab.
