Ugh.  I really want to contribute to the community.  I do!  If others before me wouldn't have done it, I wouldn't be where I am.  

So I visit [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) often.  But I'm getting depressed...

Why?

**A) Off topic posts are closed**
Not sure what makes an off topic or non-informative post... but I've answered two or three now that were closed after I posted my answer.  All that work, now the question is gone.  The best explanation I got is that it wasn't in Q/A format... So???  Sometimes discussion is good.  If this really is a problem, move it to a discussion section then...

**B) Useless answers up voted**
There's a pretty long question and someone puts in the comments a simple, "duh" style answer.  "Just do this" they say.  Then, the comments erupt with a back-and-forth dialog about how that isn't any help.  Put some effort into your answer!  Stop just trying to be "First!"

**C) Tough questions are not answered**
I've posted maybe one or two questions so far - they were tough ones.  The best answer I've gotten was people posting links to unrelated questions.  None of my tough questions are answered.  So... am I to believe that the truly intelligent are not going to the site anymore either - as I'm much more likely to do in the future?

Don't get me wrong... **I like Stack Overflow** and have found value in some of the answers.  But for those occasional visitors like me (I visit once a week to add my responses), it's really frustrating.  I've been doing it to make sure that I give back - but when the barrier to give back is so full of annoyance and trolls, its really hard to do so...

Cmon.  Grr.  Rant over. :)
