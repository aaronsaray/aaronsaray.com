Want a CSS3 **ONLY** read more link?  I think I've created one that should do the trick.

[![Screenshot 2015-04-05 19.48.23](/uploads/2015/Screenshot-2015-04-05-19.48.23-300x223.png)](/uploads/2015/Screenshot-2015-04-05-19.48.23.png){: .thumbnail}

The concept is simple: background image that is a gradient, a height limit, and a read more link that really is a checkbox - so you can track the stage. (Fun fact: I tried using a:active selector - doh!  That's only while you're clicking a link.)

Want to check out a demo?  [See it in action here]({{ site.baseurl }}/demo/css-only-read-more.html).

Now, time for some code.

First, the html markup:

```html
<article class="has-read-more">
  <input type="checkbox" class="show-more">
  <section>
    <p>Collaboratively administrate empowered markets via plug-and-play networks. Dynamically procrastinate B2C users after installed base benefits. Dramatically visualize customer directed convergence without revolutionary ROI.</p>
    <p>Efficiently unleash cross-media information without cross-media value. Quickly maximize timely deliverables for real-time schemas. Dramatically maintain clicks-and-mortar solutions without functional solutions.</p>
    <p>Completely synergize resource sucking relationships via premier niche markets. Professionally cultivate one-to-one customer service with robust ideas. Dynamically innovate resource-leveling customer service for state of the art customer service.</p>
    <p>Objectively innovate empowered manufactured products whereas parallel platforms. Holisticly predominate extensible testing procedures for reliable supply chains. Dramatically engage top-line web services vis-a-vis cutting-edge deliverables.</p>
  </section>
</article>
```

The important parts is to have a container with the class of .has-read-more, have a checkbox with a class of .show-more and then have a section immediately after it.

Here is the CSS

```css
section {
  text-align: justify;
}
section p {
  margin-top: 0;
}
.has-read-more {
  position: relative;
  width: 300px;
}
.has-read-more section {
  height: 160px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
.show-more {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 10px;
  width: 140%;
  text-align: center;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin: 0;
  margin-left: -20%;
}
.show-more:after {
  content: "read more";
  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent, white);
  padding-bottom: 10px;
  display: block;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: black;
}
.show-more span {
  background: white
}
input[type=checkbox]:checked {
  display: none;
}
input[type=checkbox]:checked + section {
  height: auto;
}
```

The section style is just for this demo.  The really user-configurable sections are the .has-read-more width and the .has-read-more section height.  Oh, and the content I suppose of 'read more' could be changed (think: inline data image?)

I want to give credit to these two articles that helped inspire me: [css deck](http://cssdeck.com/labs/css-only-showhide) and [css fade out](https://css-tricks.com/text-fade-read-more/).
