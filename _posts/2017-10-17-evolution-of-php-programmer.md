I think around 2015, there was a big splash of good training online for PHP.  Frameworks upgraded/changed, helped programmers write better code faster earlier than that.  Before that, it was a lot of RTFM.  So, before, in the earlier days (maybe somewhat still today), I think PHP developers did this:

- create crappy functional code
- create crappy OO code
- choose a random framework and mess up the implementation of it
- write your own framework
- choose you framework of choice and start to implement things great and rigidly to that framework
- create great code, using a framework as a tool and time-saver

I think some of these steps are skipped now because of the sheer size and quality of training that we have access to now these days.

However, I was talking to Big Boy the other day (you might remember big boy from [entries]({% post_url 2007-06-28-ajax-security-research-and-findings-round-1 %}) [such]({% post_url 2007-06-27-emulation-of-collections-true-stories-of-data-object-handling %}) as [these]({% post_url 2007-06-12-setting-config-variables-constants-vs-abstract-class-access %}))  He had a different explanation of the lifecycle of programmers:

- Stage 1: write shitty functional code 
- Stage 2: write shitty half assed OOP code 
- Stage 3: write awesome OOP code 
- Stage 4: Write awesome functional code
-  Stage 5: hack shitty stuff together based on business needs

I think I can agree with this, too.  But, I want to abstract this a bit.  What I think we're both saying is that there is a progression of PHP (and other language) programmers that is manifested by the way we implement and use our tools at hand.

- brave new world of programming, you're excited
- try to do better at it
- do the "best practices" of it according to "everyone"
- develop a flow that fits your logical brain/skillset best
- start to focus on creating efficient code that solves business problems, code is secondary to problem solving

I think the point I'm trying to make is - there are many ways to get to the end - but the end is crafting quality code, that fits you, that solves the business problems the best.  All of those are equally important.  Great code that doesn't solve the problem - or shitty code that solves the business problem (short-term) will always be a failure.
