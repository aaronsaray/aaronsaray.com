I created this Udemy course a while ago - but unfortunately they said it was too short and the audio was too poor.  In order to post the course, I'd need to add another 10 minutes of fluff and get a better microphone.  I decided just to share with you.

So, exactly like I'd present at a conference, here is a screencast of this presentation!
