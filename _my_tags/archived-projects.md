As an entrepreneur and open source programmer, I've created a lot of programming projects, sites and web apps.  Blog entries tagged "acrhived-projects" are projects that I no longer support and I have archived.  You'll find rationales, postmortems, details and lessons-learned from these projects in these entries.
