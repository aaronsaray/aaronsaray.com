... in Google Chrome.  Yep.  

I tested in Firefox and Internet explorer and had no problem.  However, using the form plugin and submit input types with the name of `submit` did not work.  I changed their name to `submitbutton` and they all worked flawlessly.  

Hope this saves someone the trouble it caused me!
