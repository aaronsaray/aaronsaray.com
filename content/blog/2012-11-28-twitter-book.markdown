This idea is about the concept of grouping tweets in a meaningful way.

The website TwitterBook would make collections of associated tweets.  Each collection is called a 'book' and has a title and a description.  Additionally, the collection has a unique link to identify that book and make it shareable.  

Each page is a tweet by a person with their profile picture and relevant tweet/twitter information.  You can page through the tweets in chronological order.

Collections are curations based on a couple of factors: hash tag, location, and date range.  The collection specifies that the tweet book is either or both hashtag/location based.  For date range, it could have a start/stop - or just be 'forever.'

When browsing the site, a google map would list icons for twitterbooks if they were location based.  If there are no books in your browsing location - but individual tweets - you would be encouraged to build a book from the tweets.  Title/description could be guessed from the content of the surrounding tweets.

One of the main goals of this site would be to make meaningful books based on location and date range.  For example, if you were browsing near a stadium, you might see books for various football games - and then be able to follow the conversation.
