Goal: to create a bachelor cookbook and sell it to other bachelors online.  The price of the cookbook was to be very cheap so that it wasn't too much of a risk.  The book itself was supposed to be picture rich and very verbose.  It showed how to accomplish tasks that other books assumed a person knew.

Technology/Process:

thebetterbachelor.com was redirected to /10dish for 10 Dish Cookbook.  The thought was at some point to broaden the platform if the cookbook was successful.

This was a one page selling page with a paypal link.  It simply talked about the features of the book, the cost of creating your own meals, and compared this all to going out.  The cost savings was emphasized.

I also appeared to give an 'author's note' to the potential customer.

If the visitor chose to purchase, it was a paypal IPN process.  So they received a success message and then they were emailed a link to download the PDF when paypal finished the transaction.  The link contained a special URL that used Zend Framework to read in the source PDF and stamp their name and email on each page.

There was also a coupon system that bypassed the purchase system and allowed an instant copy to be sent.

Lessons Learned

I learned that I really needed to give away a free chapter.  Up until receiving the product, visitors did not know the quality of the book. It could have been horrible with no pictures.

After speaking with a SEO expert I know, he set me up with an A/B test.  Unfortunately, not a lot was determined from that.  His suggestions was to develop the newsletter style approach which seems to work.  Hook people for some free information, and make a sales pitch later.  I never thought of doing this because when I purchase something myself, I want it.  I don't want to wait till I get a few emails about it first.  But, he says this seems to be the best way to market items like this.

Overall, it was a good project.  I didn't sell as many as I'd like but I paid for the cost of the food - and that was enough for me!
