When I installed Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04, I had the problem where the terminal would boot up until it said something about checking battery state, and then freeze.  If I flipped to a different terminal, I could sudo launch lightdm - and then login on the first terminal.  Obviously, this wasn't my first choice in fixing this, though.

After doing a little bit more digging, I found it was a combination of issues with my nvidia configuration and boot time.  I'm not an ubuntu wiz, so I don't know the specifics really.  However, I was able to make the following fix to fix my issue:

Edit **`/etc/init/lightdm.conf`**

Find the line `exec lightdm`

Put `sleep 1` above it.

This causes it to wait another second before it launches lightdm.  This gives the nvidia driver enough time to catch up I guess.
