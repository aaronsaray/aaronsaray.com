I experiment a lot with thoughts and process. I used to be scared of implementing something new because I felt like I was now married to that.  Or, if it becomes habit, maybe I won't want to stop it, even if it's annoying (how irrational does that sound?  But if you're honest with yourself, you'll see that happen a lot.  If you ever hear "that's just how we do it" then you're experiencing it.)

### The Questions

I was looking for a tip, a tool, a blueprint to determine if an experimental process should remain in my toolbox.  I wanted a process to figure out if I should continue to do this or if it was a waste of time.  That's when I thought of the two questions you need to ask yourself.

#### Is It Actually Useful?

Sounds like a silly question to ask yourself.  But maybe it could be rephrased to some extend: "How useful is it?"  Is it solving a problem or does it seem like legacy from something else.

#### Could You Live Without It?

Now that you've experienced this new process, could you live without it?  For example, let's say you introduce a new set of meetings to keep up to speed on a certain project.  After a while, you ask could you live without it?  Maybe you aren't any closer to the project than you were before - or maybe it's just too much information. That's a yes, you could live without it.

#### Yes and No

Yes, it's useful and provides value.  No, I couldn't live without it. I'd be in a worse place.  Now you know if your new process should continue.

### Putting It Into Practice

Now, you have a blueprint and permission to experiment with process.  Develop a new process, set a goal, and then put a reminder to ask yourself this question after say... 6 weeks.  Was this new process useful? Can everyone live without it?  If it's anything but a Yes, No - then it's time to rethink, refine or destroy that process.
