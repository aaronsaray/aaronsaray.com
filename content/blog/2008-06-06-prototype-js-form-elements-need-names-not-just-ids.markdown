title: Prototype JS - form elements need names, not just IDs
tags:
- javascript
---
So, I got stuck on this bug for an hour - so I thought I'd write it down.

I was using prototype js's serialize command on a form.  I was also using a strict xhtml doctype.  My form elements had IDs only - and did not have names.  Well, serialize kept coming back empty.  Turns out that prototype requires there to be names on each of the elements.

**UPDATE:** Der - according to W3C, the `name` attribute of the `form` tag is deprecated, not the name attribute of the form elements...
