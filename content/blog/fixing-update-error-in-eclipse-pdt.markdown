The last time I downloaded Eclipse PDT for PHP, (located at [zend.com/pdt](http://zend.com/pdt)), everything was great.  That is, until I wanted to run the updates.  It stopped with an error and would never update my PDT.  Luckily, one of the consultants from ("the triangle") had the same issues - and he was able to tell me what was up:

Every time I ran the update, I'd get a message saying "Network Connection problems encountered during search."  My other plugins/modules above this would update fine, but this one (and everyone below it) would stop.  Turns out, it was the entry called `zend`.

When clicking on the zend item in the list of updates, the edit button becomes available.  Changing the url from `http://downloads.zend.com/phpide` (because this is the old name, silly zend!) to `http://downloads.zend.com/pdt` solves the issue.  Then, you will be able to get your PDT updates.
