So, when did I get heartburn?  I remember hearing about it - having good friends who had it - but I never had it.  I mean, here and there - but that was usually after doing something that deserved it.  But, suddenly I have heartburn now?

Maybe it happened when I crossed that 350lb marker.  To the rest of the world, that's 158 kilograms - or to my dream to do a pull up someday, that's 1.5 metric dicktons of weight.

You might remember back in early 2015, I decided to go out and [start my own company](/2015/started-my-own-company).  I had a very noble reason for leaving my job - I didn't care anymore, and I didn't feel like I should draw a salary if I was just going through the motions.  I was constantly tired - and as a trusted friend and coworker said "man - it seems like you're in a fight every day."  I was just very tired of that corporate world - so I went off on my own.

I became an **entrepreneur** - the spectacle of the American Dream.  I owned my own business and was very soon going to be rich.

Not really.

But, that certainly wasn't the fault of my incredible well-wishers - people who might have been just a tad overzealous with their support - or their blind desire to build me up.  Too much, too soon - based on what?  You'd be surprised how many people told me that I'd do amazing, I'm going to kill it, and its about time - we always knew you'd be successful.  *(One friend told me I was foolish - and a year later, I can say that my bitterness towards him was misplaced - he was right.  But more on that later.)*

Everyone seemed to think I'd be successful, so I thought I would be too.  Now, mind you, I didn't *know* I'd be successful - you know - that blind hubris and insane drive that most entrepreneurs have... You could say that I almost believed success to deserved or predictable due to the simple math of it. I'm a good programmer, there are people who need work done: 1 + 2 = success.

It didn't work out that way.

For the first few months, things seemed good.  I mean, not great - I was already on the ramen diet - but that's only because I left my job without having a savings account.  **problem numero uno - do not quit work without a savings account**

I decided to do some passion projects.  I realized a number of fun little website projects I wanted to do... all to the tune of negative income.  **problem number 2 - focusing on passion and ignoring the bank account.**

I did everything right from a pure business side of things. I had goals, I set up my accounts properly, I billed responsibly and accurately.

But here's the problem - I really do not like making WordPress sites - that is to say: **problem #3 - if you have a specific niche, make sure it exists outside of your day-to-day job**  I work on a lot of large-scale website projects - but these projects which I'm experienced with require more than just a single programmer to hit the deadlines.  I lost contracts because I was a one-man shop.

Halfway through the business, I had made all the cuts I could imagine.  I sold stuff, I ate only the cheapest (see: most unhealthy food), cut out Netflix, going out, talking to people, playing guitar, being happy.  None of that seemed to help me be successful.  Oh and exercise? Fuck that - I don't have time for exercise, sleeping properly, or taking care of myself.  I need to make that money.

Please see the sarcasm and irony in those last few statements.

There are some long boring details I'll leave out, but let's fast-forward here.  I ended up joining a company and becoming a partner with another entrepreneur on a project that he had been working on for over 4 years.  I was the tech "co-founder" and he was the sales guy.  I worked hard, I did all the things that I thought we needed, and we barely got funding to keep us going for a few more months.  

**problem #4 401k is the last resort - and I hit my last resort**

I took out the remaining part of my 401k and lived off that.  (Yes, I have the worst tax-bill this year - hello payment plans!)  I pretty much got down to nothing - no extra items, no savings, and I even missed my mortgage one month.

Something had to change.  

I had the tough talk with my business partner - said I had to move on.  He mentioned something about sacrifices; I believe that I had done them.  However, I wasn't willing to sell my house, to live in a studio apartment, etc... so maybe I wasn't willing to sacrifice enough.  I did my part, I was proud of it, and we parted ways.

So I'm broke.  I pushed away a lot of my friends (I'm alone).  I feel the health problems creeping up (man, steps are way hard these days).  I closed my business, I sold the shares of my partnership, I'm done.

**I'm a failure**

But you know, that's ok.  I wrote one time that sometimes it's ok to [just be great](/2012/dont-always-lead-sometimes-just-be-great) - which was more of an essay about not always becoming the boss.  But I guess that means you don't always have to be the owner either.  You don't always have to be the entrepreneur.

I used to have a retirement goal of owning a company that supports 50 families through high quality, competitive paid jobs.  But, I've learned a lot this last year - and I'm not sure if that's what I want anymore.

I'm not sure I'm an entrepreneur.

Maybe I'm just made to [create great things](https://github.com/aaronsaray).  And maybe that's ok.  I can't run a company if I can't walk up steps.  I can't make decisions for years to come if I die of a heart attack.  I can't say I'm a great dog owner if I get tired walking the dog after 1 block.  I can't stay sane without a friend or two around.

So I'm a failure.  And I knew I might fail - and that's ok.  We all learn through failure.

I thought I'd fail and learn more about how to run my next business.  But perhaps, I've learned something different.  Perhaps I should be working on building great things and leading teams - and not necessarily being the entrepreneur and business owner.

So, I decided to put my tail between my legs, admit I had a problem and go and work for "[the man](http://imoneza.com)."  

I gotta say, this was the best experience of my life that I can remember, though.  I'm now part of a team where we're creating something great.  I can now start putting my life back together, and I feel pretty happy and confident having moved on from this last year.  I kept thinking I'd miss it - and there are parts I do (complete autonomy of work hours, creating a product you alone are responsible for, etc) - but I think the benefits now - just being happy - far outweigh any of those.  

I'm looking forward to continuing to create awesome things and blog about them.  I'm looking forward to making a bit of money and getting off the ramen and Cheetos diet - looking forward to paying off some credit card bills and starting a retirement account again - and looking forward to making my life healthier.  Healthier choices, healthier outlook on life, and connecting again with people.

Do I regret it? I mean, it was a pretty big **failure**, right?  

I regret certain things - or how I handled certain stresses.  I regret *some* of the decisions I made - but overall, no I do not regret this.  Not many people can say they decided to just go for it - which I did.  I can't regret that at all.
