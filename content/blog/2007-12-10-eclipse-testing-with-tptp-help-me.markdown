I recently came across this tutorial here about [Testing with TPTP](http://www.vogella.de/articles/EclipseTPTP/article.html)- and I'm confused.  Whats the benefit of this type of testing (um... creating JAVA code for a JUnit test... right?) compared to running some PHPUnit, Selenium and AB (from apache, or something...)?  What am I missing - does anyone have any other good hands-on tutorials?
