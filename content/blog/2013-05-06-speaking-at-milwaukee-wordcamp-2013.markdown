As you may or may not be able to tell, I use Wordpress on this website.   So, I guess that makes me a fan... (trust me, as a programmer, I've always toyed around with writing my own custom blog software just for my domain - but alas, other aspirations always trumped that.  Plus, wordpress is perfect for what I need.)

Last year, I spoke about [Wordpress Plugin Security]({% post_url 2012-06-03-finished-up-wordcamp-milwaukee-2012 %}) - for the first Milwaukee Wordcamp ever.  I had a great time and really liked it.

This year, I'll be again at the conference, giving my talk for this year entitled "7 Things I Wish Someone Would Have Told Me" - a talk about what I've learned over my many years of being a programmer.  I'm excited to share this talk - and to hopefully help other programmers who are coming up in the ranks - as well as remind all the mentors out there what we need to teach the youngin's.

So, if you're free June 7-9, and have $20 to spare (Yup, its $25 - but use `SARAY` as a coupon code and you'll save five bucks), go over to [Milwaukee WordCamp 2013](http://2013.milwaukee.wordcamp.org/ ) website and register now. :)
