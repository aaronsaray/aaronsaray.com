On February 28, 2007, JEMDiary 3.0 was released. Since 2001, JEMDiary has been growing, adding new features and hosting more diaries. To take advantage of the newest technologies as well as give JEMDiary a needed face-lift, 3.0 was launched. Don't worry - if you had a JEMDiary account before the upgrade, your account is still active and all your entries still remain. Check it out and look at the new features.
