One of the steps to install PHPUnit is to execute the following pear commands:
    
```bash
pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
pear install phpunit/PHPUnit
```

However, after doing that, I got the following error: no release available for package `pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit` - and the install failed.  

I decided to execute a remote-list command - it was a thought that maybe I could see if maybe my phpunit declaration was wrong - I was just grasping at straws...
    
```bash
pear remote-list -c phpunit
```

This finally gave me a worthwhile error! `The value of the config option cache_dir (/tmp/pear/cache) is not a directory and attempts to create the directory have failed`

So, I finally was successful after the following two commands:
    
```bash
mkdir /tmp/pear/cache
pear install phpunit/PHPUnit
```

Moral of the story: check to make sure PEAR has a cache directory available if you can't install a PEAR package.
