title: 'Zend Framework: Bootstrap vs Front Controller Plugin'

Today I was reviewing some old code I wrote in Zend Framework.  One of the things I was doing in the `Bootstrap.php` file was creating an function called `_initViewSettings()`.  In here I set a bunch of values for the xhtml version, the css files to include, etc.  Now I realize my mistake:

<!--more-->

**Do not include functions in the bootstrap.php file that will never be used by command line.**

Since Zend Framework projects can be launched via command line and via web page, there needs to be no overlap in the `bootstrap.php` file between uses.  There should only be bootstrapping code - that is to say, things required in order to access or initialize global resources.  The view and its settings are not a global usage object. 

Instead, create a front controller plugin.

Front controller plugins are launched whenever there is a request as a webpage.  They are not ran when a CLI program is ran.  (Don't get this confused with definition and initialization.  The bootstrap class has to define and initialize them - it just doesn't invoke them).  

Let's see this in practice.  Here's my before:

{{< filename-header "application/Bootstrap.php" >}}
```php
class Bootstrap extends Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Bootstrap
{
  protected function _initViewSettings()
  {
    $this->bootstrap('view');
    $view = $this->getResource('view');
    $view->doctype('HTML5');
    $view->setEncoding('UTF-8');
    $view->prependStylesheet('/css/main.css');
  }
  // ...
}
```

Now, afterward, make sure front controller plugins are defined, and then create a front controller plugin.  After:

{{< filename-header "application/Bootstrap.php" >}}
```php
class Bootstrap extends Zend_Application_Bootstrap_Bootstrap
{
  protected function _initFrontControllerPlugins()
  {
    $front = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance();
    $front->registerPlugin(new Application_Plugin_ViewSetup());
  }
  // ...
}
```

{{< filename-header "application/plugins/ViewSetup.php" >}}
```php
class Application_Plugin_ViewSettings extends Zend_Controller_Plugin_Abstract
{
  public function routeShutdown($request)
  {
    $bootstrap = Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance()->getParam('bootstrap');
    $view = $bootstrap->bootstrap('view')->getResource('view');

    $view->doctype('HTML5');
    $view->setEncoding('UTF-8');
    $view->prependStylesheet('/css/main.css');
  }
}
```

Remember, always remove non-essential code from the bootstrap process.
