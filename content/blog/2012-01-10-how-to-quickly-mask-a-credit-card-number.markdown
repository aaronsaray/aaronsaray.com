So, often I have to show a masked credit card on the screen.  However, I really want to go the extra mile and show the user a secure, fully masked credit card number that still reflects their original card.  For example, if their credit card number is only 15 numbers long, I shouldn't show a 16 character long string.  So, I've developed this code snippet:

<!--more-->

```php
$cc='1234123412341234';
$masked = str_pad(substr($cc, -4), strlen($cc), '*', STR_PAD_LEFT);
```

This simply takes the credit card, `substr()` the last 4 digit into the `str_pad()` method as the input.  Then, says the length of the output string should be `strlen()` of the actual input.  The pad character is a `*`.  Finally, pad everything on the left.  This way, no matter what, the output length will be the same as the input string, and it will be padded correctly.
