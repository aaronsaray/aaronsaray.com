I've always found it annoying when programmers create systems where you create your account and then you're not logged in.  Maybe I'm lazy?  I decided to do a poll on a popular social networking site.  The poll went like this:

**When signing up for a new web site, do you mind logging in after signing up?**

The two options were:

  * **If I create an account, it should already log me in.**

  * **I don't mind logging in after I create my account (it proves I know my password)**

Overwhelmingly (ok only 78% but still...) response has been in favor of creating an account and logging in automatically.  I think that we should take the extra step when creating applications to make this process streamlined for users.
