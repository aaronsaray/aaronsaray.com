I was talking with one of the junior programmers on my team about naming method names.  He was having problems coming up with ones that seemed to make sense to him and to the application.  I broke it down how I think about it:

**Controllers** are people/user speak.  Name those actions after something that a user would actually say.

**Services** are programmer speak.  What is this programming actually going to do.

**Mappers** are data speak.  What specifically is happening to the data when it goes in or comes out of this method.

I think this helped clear it up for him, what do you think?
