> First, I just want to say up front that this is not a discussion of "is 100% test coverage necessary" or a discussion about testing private methods.  This is simply how you may do it if you wanted to.

### Testing Protected/Private Attributes using PHPUnit

PHPUnit has this built in - simply use `PHPUnit_Framework_Assert::readAttribute()`.  So, for example, lets say our object User has a protected role id of `1`.

```php?start_inline=1
public function testUserRoleIsOne()
{  
  $user = new User();
  $this->assertEquals(1, PHPUnit_Framework_Assert::readAttribute($user, '_roleId'));
}
```

### Testing Protected/Private Methods in PHPUnit

This method is mainly reflection based.  The PHPUnit component is really only the testing. Lets say a protected method `_getKey()` of the User object returns a value of `mysuperawesomekey`

```php?start_inline=1
public function testRetrieveKeyFromUser()
{
  $user = new User();
    
  $reflectionOfUser = new ReflectionClass('User');
  $method = $reflectionOfUser->getMethod('_getKey');
  $method->setAccessible(true);
    
  $this->assertEquals('mysuperawesomekey', $method->invokeArgs($user, array()));
}
```
    
This code creates a new object of our object that we'd like to test.  Then, it creates a reflection of it and its method that we want to test.  Next it sets it to accessible.  Finally, in the assertion, the `invokeArgs()` method of a `reflectionmethod` is called using the object instance to call it.  The empty `array()` is because this method does not accept parameters.  If your method did, you would put them there.

In my code, I add a static method to handle most of the testing setup for protected/private methods to a helper class so I don't have to duplicate the above code.
