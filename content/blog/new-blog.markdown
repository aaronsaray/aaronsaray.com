So I've decided to move my website off of wordpress and on to [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - so you might notice it is a bit faster ;)

<!--more-->

However, I've got a lot to learn. Like, for example, how to enable comments. You may remember my one [rant about enabling comments]({{< ref "/blog/enable-your-blog-comments-already" >}}) and then notice that I don't have any comments on this blog. Hrm - I'm not entirely certain if I want to do that.

With the new blog comes some other sad news. I've "stolen" the design from [201 Creative](http://201creative.com) for this blog. The reason is sad: I've decided to shut down business and move on to a full time job.

I am proud to say, though, that I've accepted an offer at iMoneza as a Senior Software Engineer. Woo!

That's all for now - and in lieu of comments, feel free to visit my [contact](/contact) page.
