When I launched the Laravel Hacker 7 Question Security Quiz, I gathered aggregate, privatized anonymous results.  The quiz helped programmers understand how secure their app is - and the answers helped me understand what things to talk about in the future regarding security.

These self-reported quiz answers have been gathered into a whitepaper from over 1,000 developers in 2021.  Download the 14 page PDF below.
