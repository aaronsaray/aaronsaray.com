When browsing the documentation for chrome, I came across this:

<!--more-->

```javascript
window.performance.getEntries();
```
    
This gives a dump of all the connection and timing information available to the Javascript Timing and Resource API.  

Why this is an idea?  There could be a service which is just a tiny javascript library inserted on the page that tracks and records this information for each visitor.  Additional information can be correlated with it then.

So, why is this useful?

  * You can now tell how many people have an empty cache vs a full cache.  

  * When do most DNS queries take longer / does google CDN help

  * Do logged in users have a warmer cache, faster load time, than non logged in users.

I think there is tremendous information to be gathered basically from remote visitor's network tab.  Pretty sweet.
