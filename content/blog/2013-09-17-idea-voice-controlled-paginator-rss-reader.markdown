I've been thinking about this idea for a while...

<!--more-->

Basically, get a RSS reader type website - so maybe even like feedly (or make a chrome extension for it, like I've done before)... and parse RSS feeds.  

Next, put them all in the display as list items and use CSS transitions to page between them.

Next, use voice commands - [Annyang.js](https://www.talater.com/annyang/) is a great voice command library for this.  So imagine seeing your feed, and then saying "next" or "previous" to css transition to the next one.  Say "open" to open the article in a new tab.

If you really want to take it a step further, use text to speech back at ya: [text to speech protocol idea](http://ajaxian.com/archives/text-to-speech-via-html5-audio).

Wow :)  

Somehow, I just imagine myself saying "Computer!" - like in star trek now...
