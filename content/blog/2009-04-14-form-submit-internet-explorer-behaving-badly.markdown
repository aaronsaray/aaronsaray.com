I just want to make a micro blog here.  Just a tiny lil blog.

### Internet Explorer Does Not Submit Form on Enter

Correct!  Instead, I load my page with this jquery

```javascript
$('input').keydown(function(e) {
  if (e.keyCode == 13) {
    $(this).parents('form').submit();
    return false;
  }
});
```
    
### Button Element Not Submitting in Internet Explorer

Correct!  Mainly because I was lazy.

But in FireFox  works fine for a submit.

In IE - don't forget to add `type="submit"`

```html
<button>Works in FF</button>
<button type="submit">Works and is probably what you SHOULD do</button>
```

That is all.
