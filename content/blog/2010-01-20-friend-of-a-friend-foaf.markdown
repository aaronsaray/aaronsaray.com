So I added my own FOAF link on my home page.

For those who aren't familiar, Friend of a Friend is a protocol defined to help machines read relationships between entities (persons) on the internet.  The relationships are set up in RDF file.  (Mine is severely limited - either I have no friends - or am just lazy - you tell me!)  For more info, check out [http://www.foaf-project.org/](http://www.foaf-project.org/).

By far, the best library I've found for parsing FOAF files is located here: [http://gna.org/projects/phoaf](http://gna.org/projects/phoaf)
