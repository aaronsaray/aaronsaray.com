The website [http://www.emailtextmessages.com/](http://www.emailtextmessages.com/) keeps a database of most of the email addresses that correlate directly to a txt for mobile phones.  However, their version is in HTML - and I see no feed.  I've compiled the list into a CSV file so that its easier to use in programming.  Do visit their website and click on an ad to support their hard work.
