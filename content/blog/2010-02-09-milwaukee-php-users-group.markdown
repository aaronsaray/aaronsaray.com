I started the Milwaukee PHP Users group a few weeks ago.  Unfortunately, today we had to cancel a meeting because of the outpouring of snow... but it's on for the 4th tuesday of the month.

You can find more details at [http://mkepug.org/](http://mkepug.org/) or stop by bucketworks every 2nd and 4th tuesday of the month.
