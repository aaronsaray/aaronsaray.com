title: MySQL Explain rows column really IS an estimate
tags:

Here is an interesting proof of concept that the 'rows' column of the explain output is actually an estimate, and not the real amount.  I KNEW it to be true, but somehow I didn't feel like it was right.  I always thought "the closer the rows # gets to the exact amount of retrieved data, the better.  Exact is what you strive for."  Turns out, that's not true.  The closer the number, the better, but its still just an estimation.  Sometimes its estimated accurately, other times its not.  See this example:

```sql
mysql> select * from city;
+----+-------------+
| id | name        |
+----+-------------+
|  1 | chicago     |
|  2 | springfield |
+----+-------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from state;
+----+------+
| id | name |
+----+------+
|  1 | IL   |
|  2 | WI   |
|  3 | MO   |
|  4 | WA   |
+----+------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from citystate;
+--------+---------+
| idcity | idstate |
+--------+---------+
|      1 |       1 |
|      1 |       2 |
|      1 |       3 |
|      2 |       1 |
|      2 |       2 |
|      2 |       3 |
|      2 |       4 |
+--------+---------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select city.name, state.name from citystate 
    -> join city on city.id=citystate.idcity  
    -> join state on state.id=citystate.idstate 
    -> where state.name='IL';
+-------------+------+
| name        | name |
+-------------+------+
| chicago     | IL   |
| springfield | IL   |
+-------------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> explain select city.name, state.name from citystate
    -> join city on city.id=citystate.idcity
    -> join state on state.id=citystate.idstate
    -> where state.name='IL'\G;

Hahah!  3 rows in city is what it estimates...

Interestingly enough, however, if you add an index...
    
```sql
ALTER TABLE `city` ADD INDEX `name_idx` (`name` ASC);
```

It is reflected accurately now.

```sql
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: city
         type: index
possible_keys: PRIMARY
          key: name_idx
      key_len: 48
          ref: NULL
         rows: 2
        Extra: Using index
