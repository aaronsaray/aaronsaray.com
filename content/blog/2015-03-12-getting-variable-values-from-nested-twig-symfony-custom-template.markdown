Today, I was working with a custom form themed symfony / twig project.  The previous developer had developed a bootstrap based theme (yes, this is an older Symfony project at this moment - I think this is a bundled theme now).  I was struggling with the block `field_row` item.  Inside of this, there was a call to `form_label` passing in just the form view again.  I was setting a custom label on the form_row() call in the main template, but nothing was happening.

_I should mention... I'm just learning this particular integration, plus this is slightly old code, so I may be partially right in my entry.  If I have something wrong, please comment!  I'd love to learn.  But, I wanted to post this because I couldn't find the answer myself._

I had the following:

**`edit.html.twig`**
```twig
{% raw %}{{ form_row(form.myItem, {'label': 'My special label'}) }}{% endraw %}
```

It wasn't grabbing my output in the custom template.  The template excerpt looked like this...
    
```twig
{% raw %}{% block field_row %}
  <div class="{{ div_class }}">
    {{ form_label(form) }}
    <div class="controls">
      {{ form_widget(form, _context) }}
      {{ form_errors(form) }}
    </div>
  </div>
{% endblock field_row %}{% endraw %}
```

In this case, the form variable passed to form_label did not have my custom variable on it.  _Caveat: it looks like its a form render view object, but I don't quite yet follow why this matters..._  Anyway, I tried using `form.get('label')` but that didn't work.

Turns out, the `_context` array had the values for this particular element.  So, I modified:
    
```twig
{% raw %}
{{ form_label(form, _context['label']) }}
{% endraw %}
```

Yay!  That got the standard label - or the custom label I set.  Success.
