So, if you know me personally, you know I'm a bit profane. I tend to keep this out of my professional work. But, I noticed that this pattern of speaking was common among a core group of my previous clients: those who have a project spiraling out of control.  So, I decided to brand "Fix My Fucking Project" to their needs.

<!--more-->

I followed a pattern that is common for single-page brochure websites. I talked about the pains the client may be experiencing, and how I could help make it better. I put in some FAQs and calls to action.  When I first launched this, I got a number of contact forms (and meetings scheduled with Calendly).

Most of the meetings ended up falling through.  And, turns out that a good portion of this work is low-budget.  I have a premium quality of work which comes with a high price tag.  The type of person this attracted had already wasted money on contractors who didn't deliver - and were reluctant to spend more.

It was a unique experience to craft this marketing content, though. I really liked it.

Here is the full screenshot of the page:

The Calendly content was missing from the big screenshot, so I included an example of that here:

I did some pretty cool open graph work for it.  When you shared on iOS you saw this:

And here is some site's preview of a bunch of other open graph and sharing contnet:

The website was fixmyfuckingproject.com and now redirects to this blog entry for the duration of the registration period. I had also registered helpmyfuckingproject.com just in case.
