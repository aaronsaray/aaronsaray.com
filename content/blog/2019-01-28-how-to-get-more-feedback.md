Feedback from your boss or superior is incredibly important. How do you know if you're getting all of the feedback they have for you, thought? Sometimes people are distracted - sometimes they don't know if they're pummeling you with too much information.

There's a simple sentence or phrase that you should use toward the end of the conversation with your boss that will answer this question.  

So you've received the feedback, and the conversation is coming to a close.  Use the following sentence:

> Is there anything else you think I should know?

There can be other forms of this: Is there anything else you think I should know, anything else I need to know, anything else you want to tell me.  It really just depends on your way of speaking.

The core idea here is to ask them again - so they have a prompt to gather their thoughts and reflect. More often than not, I've found that this leads to further discussion - sometimes the most important part of the entire conversation.
