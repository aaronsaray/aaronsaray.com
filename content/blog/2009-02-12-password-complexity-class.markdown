After many times of coding relatively the same thing, it becomes prudent to have a standard library for certain sets of processes.  Of course - that is why there are things like frameworks!  At any rate, one of the biggest things I run into is password complexity.  Each website has its own requirement for the security they want to implement.  So, let's talk about the requirements and then look at the code:

<!--more-->

### The Requirements

There are many different requirements that I've come across, but lets focus on the ones that I have defined in this class:

  * Minimum Password Length

  * Maximum Password Length

  * Require a Lowercase/Uppercase/Mixed case

  * Require a number

  * Require a special character

  * Require a password that is different than the last one

  * A password that does not contain a username

  * A password that has enough unique characters

Those are all of the needs I plan to address.  Additionally, there are some features like getting the standard password settings (which is max/min length, an upper a lower and a number) and the strict setting which is all of the requirements.

**Those of you who look at performance** might notice a few things that are not super efficient - such as having multiple calls to `preg_match` instead of combining them into a single function and using reflection and `call_user_func_array` instead of hardcoding the function names.  In most reusable libraries, performance should be king.  However, in this particular module, I think its used far less than most other bits of code, so I optimized for easy maintenance and upkeep.

### The Code

Well, lets take a look at the class:

```php
class Password
{
  /** constants - are arbritrary numbers - but used for bitwise **/
  const REQUIRE_MIN         = 1;
  const REQUIRE_MAX         = 2;
  const REQUIRE_LOWERCASE   = 4;
  const REQUIRE_UPPERCASE   = 8;
  const REQUIRE_NUMBER      = 16;
  const REQUIRE_SPECIALCHAR = 32;
  const REQUIRE_DIFFPASS    = 64;
  const REQUIRE_DIFFUSER    = 128;
  const REQUIRE_UNIQUE      = 256;

  protected $_passwordMinLength = 6;
  protected $_passwordMaxLength = 32;
  protected $_passwordDiffLevel = 3;
  protected $_uniqueChrRequired = 4;
  protected $_complexityLevel = 0;
  protected $_issues = array();

  /**
   * returns the standard options
   * @return integer
   */
  public function getComplexityStandard()
  {
    return self::REQUIRE_MIN + self::REQUIRE_MAX + self::REQUIRE_LOWERCASE 
           + self::REQUIRE_UPPERCASE + self::REQUIRE_NUMBER;
  }

  /**
   *returns all of the options
   *@return integer
   */
  public function getComplexityStrict()
  {
    $r = new ReflectionClass($this);
    $complexity = 0;
    foreach ($r->getConstants() as $constant) {
      $complexity += $constant;
    }
    return $complexity;
  }

  public function setComplexity($complexityLevel)
  {
    $this->_complexityLevel=$complexityLevel;
  }

  /**
   * checks for complexity level. If returns false, 
   * it has populated the _issues array
   */
  public function complexEnough($newPass, $oldPass, $username)
  {
    $enough = TRUE;

    $r = new ReflectionClass($this);
    foreach ($r->getConstants() as $name=>$constant) {

      /** means we have to check that type then **/
      if ($this->_complexityLevel & $constant) {

        /** REQUIRE_MIN becomes _requireMin() **/
        $parts = explode('_', $name, 2);
        $funcName = "_{$parts[0]}" . ucwords($parts[1]);

        $result = call_user_func_array(
          array($this, $funcName), array($newPass, $oldPass, $username)
        );
        if ($result !== TRUE) {
          $enough = FALSE;
          $this->_issues[] = $result;
        }
      }
    }

    return $enough;
  }

  public function getPasswordIssues()
  {
    return $this->_issues;
  }

  protected function _requireMin($newPass)
  {
    if (strlen($newPass) < $this->_passwordMinLength) {
      return 'Password is not long enough.';
    }
    return true;
  }

  protected function _requireMax($newPass)
  {
    if (strlen($newPass) > $this->_passwordMaxLength) {
      return 'Password is too long.';
    }
    return true;
  }

  protected function _requireLowercase($newPass)
  {
    if (!preg_match('/[a-z]/', $newPass)) {
      return 'Password requires a lowercase letter.';
    }
    return true;
  }

  protected function _requireUppercase($newPass)
  {
    if (!preg_match('/[A-Z]/', $newPass)) {
      return 'Password requires an uppercase letter.';
    }
    return true;
  }

  protected function _requireNumber($newPass)
  {
    if (!preg_match('/[0-9]/', $newPass)) {
      return 'Password requires a number.';
    }
    return true;
  }

  protected function _requireSpecialChar($newPass)
  {
    if (!preg_match('/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/', $newPass)) {
      return 'Password requires a special character.';
    }
    return true;
  }

  protected function _requireDiffpass($newPass, $oldPass)
  {
    if (
      strlen($newPass) - similar_text($oldPass,$newPass) < $this->_passwordDiffLevel 
      || 
      stripos($newPass, $oldPass) !== FALSE
    ) {
      return 'Password must be a bit more different than the last password.';
    }
    return true;
  }

  protected function _requireDiffuser($newPass, $oldPass, $username)
  {
    if (stripos($newPass, $username) !== FALSE) {
      return 'Password should not contain your username.';
    }
    return true;
  }

  protected function _requireUnique($newPass)
  {
    $uniques = array_unique(str_split($newPass));
    if (count($uniques) < $this->_uniqueChrRequired) {
      return 'Password must contain more unique characters.';
    }
    return true;
  }
}
```

Most of this code is pretty self explanatory.  And an example of how we might use this:

```php
$newPass = 'Turk3y*';
$oldPass = 'monkeyS3!';
$username = 'aaronsaray';

$PASSWORD = new Password();
$PASSWORD->setComplexity($PASSWORD->getComplexityStrict());
if ($PASSWORD->complexEnough($newPass, $oldPass, $username)) {
  print 'Going to change your password.';
}
else {
  print 'Cannot change your password because:<ul>';
  foreach ($PASSWORD->getPasswordIssues() as $issue) {
    print "<li>{$issue}</li>";
  }
  print '</ul>';
}
```

You might also try using the `getComplexityStandard()` method or creating your own complexity setting.  For example, if you wanted to create a site that was really lax and only required min/max and lower and uppercase, you could call the complexity routine like this:

```php
/** not recommended!! **/
$PASSWORD->setComplexity(
  Password::REQUIRE_MIN + Password::REQUIRE_MAX 
  + Password::REQUIRE_LOWERCASE + Password::REQUIRE_UPPERCASE
);
```
