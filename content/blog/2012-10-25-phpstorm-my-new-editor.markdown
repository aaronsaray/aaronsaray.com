We've just migrated to the [PHPStorm IDE](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) in my team.  Commercial licenses are $200, personal are $100.  I believe that the investment was well worth it.  If you've been following my entries, you know I have a love affair with [Eclipse PDT](http://www.zend.com/en/community/pdt/).  It has been hard for an open source programmer like myself to want to buy software.  But, we did it.

In the next few weeks, you can expect to hear some cool information about PHPStorm.  In the mean time, I suggest checking out the trial.  My favorite features include better code recognition, code completion of one language embedded inside of another (think HTML in PHP), and integrated test results.
