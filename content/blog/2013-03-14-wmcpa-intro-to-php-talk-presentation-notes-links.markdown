Just finished a talk at the [Wisconsin Midrange Computer Professional Association](http://www.wmcpa.org/) and wanted to share the info.  This particular talk was an introduction to PHP.

#### Useful Links

**The Environment**

  * On Windows?  Check out [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)

  * Mac?  Download [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html)

  * Linux: Try [taskel install lamp-server](https://www.google.com/?q=tasksel%20install%20lamp-server)

**PHP Resources**

  * Check out [PHP.net](http://php.net) for all your information.

  * I like to search function names by adding them after the .net of the PHP url... so do search strlen(), you can do [php.net/strlen](http://php.net/strlen)
