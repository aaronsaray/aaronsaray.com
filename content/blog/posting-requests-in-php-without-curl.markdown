Can it be done? YES!  Luckily, functions like `file_get_contents()` support stream contexts.

In this example, I want to post to my form my login credentials of username `aaron` and password `chicken`.  This will be posting to the URL of `http://test.com/login.do.php`.  I'll show the code first, and then let's talk about what it does.

```php
$args = array ('username'=>'aaron', 'password'=>'chicken');
$uri = 'http://test.com/login.do.php';

$opts = array(
  'http' => array(
    'method'=>'POST', 
    'header'=>'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 
    'content'=>http_build_query($args)
  )
);

$context = stream_context_create($opts);

$result = file_get_contents($uri, false, $context);

print $result;
```

Let's dissect line by line:

The first line dealing with `$args` is setting up our post parameters.  The next line is our uri target.  If this was an HTML form, it might look like this:

```html
<form action="http://test.com/login.do.php" method="POST">
Username: <input name="username"></input><br></br>
Password: <input name="password"></input><br></br>
<input type="submit"></input>
</form>
```

The next line is the `$opts` array.  This will be the options that we send to the stream context.  The array is keyed by the type of stream we're creating here - in this case `http`.  This points to an array of options.  First, the method of the request, in this case `POST`.  Next, the header that must be sent in order to submit the request.  For the most part, your browser handles sending this - but we have to specify it here.  It simply is keying the request to let it know that its a form submission.  The final key is the content key - which is what is submitted in a typical request below the headers.  Here we're using PHP's `http_build_query()` to save ourselves some time.

Moving on, we create a new context using `stream_context_create()`, assign that to $context using `$opts` as our parameter.  Think of `$context` not as a value, but as a handle - similar to an fopen or other resource handle.

Finally, we retrieve the contents of our request using `file_get_contents()`.  Do note: you must have `fopen_url = true` in your **`php.ini`**.  This allows us to retrieve content via an external URL.  We pass the location of our post request, false because we don't want send any additional flags, and a pointer to our stream context.

After this is complete, we should have the output in the `$result` variable.
