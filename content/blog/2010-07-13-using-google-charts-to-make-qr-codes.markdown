Google Charts is my hero yet again.  This time, I happened to notice that they have a chart in their API for QR Codes.  Considering I was just searching google for a PHP class to do this, I was pretty ecstatic.

To implement, I made a quick line of jQuery to generate my QR Codes.  Of course, I did this after the page loaded :)  My goal was to generate a QR code for the page that the user is currently viewing.  Pretty simple:

```javascript
$("#qrImage").attr(
  'src', 
  'http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=150x150&cht;=qr&chl;=' 
    + escape(window.location.href) 
    + '&choe;=UTF-8'
);
```

You can find all of the details and other parameters here: [http://code.google.com/apis/chart/docs/gallery/qr_codes.html](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/docs/gallery/qr_codes.html)
