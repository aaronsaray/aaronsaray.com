title: 'Zend Framework ACL: Inherits Including'

So one of the things that really bothered me about the Zend ACL implementation in 1.x was the `inherits()` method.  It simply would test to see if the current role inherited the roles you were testing against.  Well, what if the role WAS the tested role?  Then it would fail.  So, to fix that, in my own `Application_Model_Acl` implementation, I wrote `inheritsIncluding()`.  

<!--more-->

**`Acl.php`**
```php
<?php
class Application_Model_Acl extends Zend_Acl
{
  // snippy
  
  public function inheritsRoleIncluding($role, $inherit, $onlyParents = false)
  {
    $inherits = $this->inheritsRole($role, $inherit, $onlyParents);
    if (!$inherits) {
      $inherits = $role == $inherit;
    }
    return $inherits;
  }  
}
```

This simply calls the parent `inheritsRole()` method passing in all required parameters.  If that is false, the last test is to see if the role actually is equal to the tested role.  `$inherits` is false, but then is set to the calculation of whether the roles are equal or not.
