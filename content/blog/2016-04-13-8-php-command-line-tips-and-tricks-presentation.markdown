I just finished giving a talk at [MKEPUG](http://www.meetup.com/Milwaukee-PHP-Users-Group/events/228866298/) about
8 PHP Command Line Tips and Tricks.  Normally I try to export my talks / slides into PDF.  This time, my presentation
was a little different - I used embedded video in KeyNote.  So, I'll provide the KeyNote file for download - sorry
to those who don't have KeyNote or a mac. :-/
