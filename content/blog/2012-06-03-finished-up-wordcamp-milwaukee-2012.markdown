Really enjoyed my time at [WordCamp Milwaukee 2012](http://2012.milwaukee.wordcamp.org/).  Got to meet a lot of great people.  I did a presentation on [Secure Wordpress Coding](/uploads/2012/WordCamp-Milwaukee-2012-Aaron-Saray-Secure-Wordpress-Coding.pdf).  Feel free to download the slides.

I'll update this with a link to Wordpress.tv of my presentation when it's up there.
