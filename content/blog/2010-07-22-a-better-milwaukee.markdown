Artsy? I know - this is a bit non standard of a blog post for me... but bear with me. :)

A fellow kayaker took this picture of Milwaukee.
[![](/uploads/2010/before-300x77.png)](/uploads/2010/before.png){: .thumbnail}

I thought it could look a little better.
[![](/uploads/2010/after-300x77.png)](/uploads/2010/after.png){: .thumbnail}

I've also attached the [PSD file](/uploads/2010/mkepsd.psd).  If you have any suggestions on how I could have done this better/faster, please let me know. :)  I'm still trying to learn how to touch up photos better.
