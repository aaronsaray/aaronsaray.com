*sigh* Things change... and so does MySpace.

I had once written an article about [how to create a great MySpace Layout]({{< ref "/blog/2007-04-04-how-to-make-a-great-myspace-layout" >}}) - but it is somewhat out of date.  I'm not sure if there is any interest in an updated article.  In case there isn't, and I decide to just remove it, I have a picture of what the original design of mine was here...
