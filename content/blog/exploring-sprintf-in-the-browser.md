`sprintf` is an amazing function that doesn't get enough love. Because of this, I had put together a little tool to explore it in the browser.

<!--more-->

The idea was simple: give people a place to explore with `sprintf` in the browser.  However, after showing it to a few people, I learned something interesting: you can't explore what you don't know.  Do you know [sprintf](https://php.net/sprintf)?

That is to say, it has been such a foreign concept to so many devs that they don't know even how to play around with it.  Based on that, I think the exploring tool is not the best solution. It's been archived.

You can still see it at the [GitHub](https://github.com/morebetterfaster/explore-sprintf) repo.  

Here is a screenshot of it.

Basically, as you typed, it would format the string using a javascript version of the same functionality. When it was invalid, it would blur out the formatted string area. When it found operators, it would open a new row below.

Feel free to fork this / copy it, and make your own tool.
