Just wanted to note this awesome registry change that you could apply to get a right-click menu on my computer that allows direct access to the event viewer in windows xp.

**`eventviewer.reg`**
    
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    
    ;Adds Add/Remove to right click of MY Computer
    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D}\shell\Event Viewer\command]
    @="eventvwr"
