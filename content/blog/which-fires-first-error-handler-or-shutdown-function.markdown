title: Which Fires First? Error Handler or Shutdown Function

I was working on writing a shutdown function for a PHP 4 script and noticed some odd behavior when I was getting errors (no way! I program and get errors? Who knew!?)  At any rate, when I would handle my error with my custom function, I noticed the shutdown function was still executing after the error function.  (Or when it was a Fatal error, the error was shown to the screen but the shutdown function was still ran...)

<!--more-->

This got me to thinking about handling error redirection pages and sending messages on fatal errors in PHP4 (you'll remember that a fatal error won't execute the error handler, and therefore most of our custom code to make a nice 'message' won't execute).  But anyway, I digress.

I'm using PHP5.2 - this is the code I used to test:

```php
function error_function() {
  print 'error function';
}

function shutdown_function() {
  print 'shutdown function';
}

set_error_handler('error_function');
register_shutdown_function('shutdown_function');

print 1/0;
```

So, as you can tell, the error handler happens FIRST and then the shutdown function
