Using an Ansible configuration, I wanted to use postfix on ubuntu to send out mail.  However, I couldn't seem to figure out exactly how to get it to stop asking for input during the `apt-get install postfix` process.  Turns out, you can use **debconf** to set the values that are necessary for the install.

Here's what you're looking for:
[Ansible debconf module](http://docs.ansible.com/debconf_module.html), and questions to answer: `postfix/mailname` and `postfix/main_mailer_type`.

Here's an excerpt of the Ansible file.
    
```yaml
---
- name: Set Postfix option hostname
  debconf: 
    name=postifx 
    question="postfix/mailname" 
    value="sandbox" 
    vtype="string"

- name: Set Postfix option type as internet site
  debconf: 
    name=postfix 
    question="postfix/main_mailer_type" 
    value="'Internet Site'" 
    vtype="string"

- name: install postfix
  apt: name=postfix state=present
```

Of course, remember to copy over your required **`postfix/main.cnf`** file after you're done, too.
