I just thought I'd drop some useful links and tools your way for those beginning and non-tool-cist peoples:

<!--more-->

[http://getfirebug.com/](http://getfirebug.com/)
Used for js/css/dom debugging - additionally, even Yahoo is building upon this.  I've used this a lot for AJAX request debugging as well.

[http://zend.com/pdt](http://zend.com/pdt)
Zend eclipse project - get the full package - this is a ton of PHP tools from Zend (the PHP company) built on top of Eclipse (for those Java tool lovers out there)

[Aptana](http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Plugging_Aptana_into_an_existing_Eclipse_configuration)
Useful for css/javascript editing in eclipse - or as a standalone

[Mysql Gui Tools](http://mysql.org/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html)
A nice gui browser for mysql - I know I know - us diehards - we shouldn't need this - but it is still nice (you can also get plugins for eclipse to do the same thing with jdbc)

[Pietty](http://ntu.csie.org/~piaip/pietty/) + [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
Pietty  - a putty plugin - allows for true transparency of putty windows  - amazingly cool - at first its in some oriental language - and when you first open it up - you can't read the screen when you first ssh somewhere.  Never fear: just go to the encoding menu option and choose utf-8 - otherwise works like a dream.  SSH to your heart's content.

[Komodo]( http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_ide/)
If you don't like Eclipse or the long time it takes to load, you can use Komodo.  Plus, version 4 brings some lovely things to the table.  Thats right, Lovely (and thats not cuz they gave me a shirt either...)

[PHPDoc](http://phpwindoc.humanprofile.biz/)
Phpdoc for windows - has a nice gui for using phpdoc - what we use for documentation because its easy to customize and launch.  (I have been using an eclipse tool though lately that I wrote....)

That's about it - if you know any other cool tools, post them in the comments!
