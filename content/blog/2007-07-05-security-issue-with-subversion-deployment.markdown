title: Security Issue with Subversion Deployment?

I use Subversion (SVN) for source control and deployment both for JEMDiary and at ("the triangle"). While working on my local copy of one of the websites, I got to thinking about the **`.svn`** folder and all of its files.  The **`.svn`** folder is a local cache/db of the file changes in order to support diffs, reverts, and to give cues about file changes and the need to commit.  I started poking around inside of the folder - and discovered the **`text-base`** folder.  Inside of there, every one of my recently changed files were in there with an extension of `.svn-base`.  Could this be a security issue - was I showing my code to the whole world?  Lets figure this out:

**Can I see the PHP content?**

Well the very first thing I did was surf on my local apache instance to one of the files inside of that folder - and it executed the PHP code!  I actually thought I'd be able to see the content, but this still wasn't the best thing to see happen. (Its never a good thing when PHP files outside of your standard directory scheme and planning can execute... this should NEVER happen).  Ok - so there is a chance for an issue here - but I'm more curious on why its executing.

**Why could I execute a PHP file with a .svn-base extension?**

Well the very first thing I thought of was multiviews.  Perhaps I have that activated to support multiple language php files?  Just to be save, I put `-MultiViews` in my config - and I could still run the file.  So then I got curious and made my own file called **`test.php`** that prints out `test` as a string.

First I ran it directly from the root of my website.  It worked successfully.  I then changed the name to **`test.php.en`** and executed **`/test.php`**. No dice.  I surfed to test.php.en - and it worked fine.  Ok - so instead of doing the smart thing and searching on google, I changed the name to **`test.php.xxx`**, **`test.xxx.php`**, **`test.xxx.xxx.php`**, **`test.php.xxx.xxx`**, and **`test.xxx.php.xxx`**.  Surfing directly to each one of them worked fine.

**There's actually a reason this is working... der...**

[`mod_mime`](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_mime.html)'s manual page from apache was very enlightening.  According to the manual page, the meta information relates the filename of the document to it's     mime-type, language, character set and encoding.  It also shows that encodings, languages, etc, can be in any order (**`index.html.en`** is the same as **`index.en.html`**).  (All of this stuff I'm certain I've read before - but this is the first time it was actually useful!)  Its also useful to know that in certain cases where encodings, languages, etc, don't match a specific set of pre-defined parameters, it falls back to a known type.  This explains why `.php.xxx` was still accepted.

So how do we protect against our remnant **`.svn`** folder's content from being executed?  We still know this is a bad idea... so lets not give up yet.  We could restrict apache's configuration down so tight that there is no graceful fallback... I think.  But as a lazy programmer, I'm going to take the easy way out...

**Deny access to .svn using some apache config options**

With our apache config, we should be able to deny access to the **`.svn`** directory.  We have two ways to finish this.  First, if you have access to your apache config file (or if you really really want to do this with your **`.htaccess`** file - although the apache config would be a better place to put it because it only gets parsed on startup - not every page load), use `mod_access` and do the following:

```apache
<directory>
  Deny from all
</directory>
```

The `Directory` directive, used with the tilde, allows for a sort of 'regular expression' (check the manual for more).  You could also use the `DirectoryMatch` directive.  With our current directive, we're going to throw the user into a 403 error.  No matter what url (`website.com/.svn`... or `website.com/images/.svn`...), they will all be denied.

Another way to do this is to use a `mod_rewrite` rule - this way we can do a 404 or just redirect them to a nicer place.  Lets redirect the user back to the index page:

```apache
RewriteRule .svn/* /
```

**Either way you solve it, solve it!**

You never know when accessing a file outside of your standard file structure can cause an issue.  Additionally, it is possible to mis-configure apache that these files may be served as plain text - and this could cause some big security issues.
