title: Is it better to write your 'for' loops backwards in PHP?

After listening to a javascript internals optimization talk, I wanted to see how these concepts could relate to PHP.  The biggest thing that stuck out to me was the order of the for loops in javascript.  

<!--more-->

According to the talk, loops written backwards (or using the deincrement operator instead of the increment one...) was a lot faster.  They said comparing a value to zero was faster than comparing a value to another value.  With the backward loop, you were always comparing to zero.  I decided to try these tests on php:

I'm not entirely solid with my testing method.  My idea was to make a forward loop and a backward loop.  Each would do one PHP action.  I'd run the test 10 times to get an idea what the mean was - did forward loops win or did backward ones win?  This is the code I used:

```php
$var = 1;
 
for ($j=0; $j < 10; $j++) {
  $time_start = microtime(true);
  for ($i=0; $i < 100000; $i++) {
    $var = 1;
  }
  $time_end = microtime(true);
  $timef = $time_end - $time_start;
  print "{$timef} - forward<br />";
 
  $time_start = microtime(true);
  for ($i=100000; 0 < $i; $i--) {
    $var = 1;
  }
  $time_end = microtime(true);
  $timeb = $time_end - $time_start;
  print "{$timeb} - backward<br />";
 
  if ($timef > $timeb) {
    print '<strong>Backward Wins</strong>';
  }
  else if ($timef < $timeb) {
    print '<strong>Forward Wins</strong>';
  }
  else {
    print 'ARE YOU KIDDING ME?';
  }
  print '<br /><hr />';
}    
```

After running the test a few times, I was actually surprised.  There really wasn't that much of a difference.  Here's an example of the output for one of my tests:

    0.061929941177368 - forward
    0.064308881759644 - backward
    **Forward Wins**
    
    
    
    * * *
    
    0.069388151168823 - forward
    0.056493997573853 - backward
    **Backward Wins**
    
    
    * * *
    
    0.065435886383057 - forward
    0.056330919265747 - backward
    **Backward Wins**
    
    
    * * *
    
    0.065697908401489 - forward

    **Backward Wins**
    
    
    * * *
    
    0.066594123840332 - forward
    0.065793991088867 - backward
    **Backward Wins**
    
    
    * * *
    
    0.059870004653931 - forward
    0.064540863037109 - backward
    **Forward Wins**
    
    
    * * *
    
    0.057721138000488 - forward
    0.064589023590088 - backward
    **Forward Wins**
    
    
    * * *
    
    0.057284832000732 - forward
    0.064239978790283 - backward
    **Forward Wins**
    
    
    * * *
    
    0.067974090576172 - forward
    0.056583166122437 - backward
    **Backward Wins**
    
    
    * * *
    
    0.068339824676514 - forward
    0.056351900100708 - backward
    **Backward Wins**
    
    
    * * *

So as you can see, there's no real proof that in PHP the order of your for loop matters.
