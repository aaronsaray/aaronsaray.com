There are two areas where user input should be filtered: on display and on storage.  Luckily, Zend Framework provides tools for this...

## Filtering User Input in the View

In any view, the Zend View Helper `escape` is available.  Whenever displaying user input, use it to escape and filter the output:

```php
echo '<p>Hello ' . $this->escape($user->getName()) . '!</p>';
```

## Filtering User Input before Persistence 

The Zend Filter `Zend_Filter_Input` exists to filter this content.  You can also add validators to it.  In this case, I am posting a numeric ID called `key` and a string field called `name`.

```php
$filters = array(
  '*'   => 'StringTrim',
  'key' => 'Digits'
);
$validators = array(
  'key' => 'Digits',
  'name'=> 'Alpha'
);
$filteredInput = new Zend_Filter_Input($filters, $validators, $_POST);
```

The `$filteredInput` variable now contains user input that has been filtered.  First, the filter of StringTrim is applied to all items in the input array (see the `*`).  The Digits filter is applied only to the key element.  Then, the validators are initiated.  The key item is validated as a `Digit` and the name item is validated as an `Alpha` type field.

When not using `Zend_Form`, be absolutely certain to filter your input in this method.
